# An item that is attached to a subscription or interest. To avoid notifying a
# user about the same item twice within the same interest, we track which items
# are "seen", per-user and per-interest. It's possible that a user will see the
# same item twice across multiple interests. This is intentional, as different
# text may be highlighted in each notification: consider, for example, a long
# bill that touches on many different subjects.
