# endpoint for syncing alerts with other services,
# for which Scout will serve as a whitelabeled alert system.
#
# Receive POSTs, with a secret key, with an array of active and inactive interests.
#
# If the service is invalid, 403.
# If the secret key is wrong for that service, 403.
#
# If the user account does exist, but has a different service,
# add it to their account like anything else. The service syncing this to us
# should understand that these new interests won't be whitelabeled. We whitelabel per-user,
# not per-interest, at this time.
#
# But note: this means that users who unsubscribed with Scout can get their settings
# reset, unless they or we communicate that back upstream to the provider we're whitelabeling for.
# So, for users who we auto-unsubscribe because Postmark returns an error, we also set
# their "confirmed" flag to false. This prevents users from being re-subscribed on sync.
#
# If the user account does not exist, create it:
#   with the provided 'service' field
#   with the provided 'notifications' field
#   with the provided email address
#   confirmed=true
#   announcements and organization_announcements as false
#   random password (unsynced with other service)
#
# If the user account is invalid somehow, 400.
#
# For active interests:
#   if it exists, do nothing
#   if it doesn't exist, create it and save it
#
# For inactive interests:
#   if it doesn't exist, do nothing
#   if it does exist, delete it
#
# Check validity of each new interest, and only save/delete interests if
# all new item interests successfully 'found' their referenced item.
# If they did not, 500 without any changes to the user's account or interests.
