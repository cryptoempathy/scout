# Scout

A government-wide search and notification system. Currently deployed to [scout.sunlightfoundation.com](https://scout.sunlightfoundation.com/).

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sunlightlabs/scout.png)](http://travis-ci.org/sunlightlabs/scout)

## Setting Up

Scout is developed and tested on **Ruby 2.1.0**.

**Recommended**: use [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) to install Ruby 2.1.0 to your home directory.

You need a MongoDB server. Scout will create its own database and collections as needed.

After a `gem install bundler`, install included dependencies with:

```bash
bundle install --local
```

Create configuration files:

```bash
cp config.ru.example config.ru
cp config/config.yml.example config/config.yml
```

Change anything in `config.yml` that needs to be changed. Among other things, you will need to add your own Sunlight API key. You can get an API key [here](http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/accounts/register/). You can change the MongoDB configuration in this file if you need to.

Then run the app on port 8080 with:

```
bundle exec unicorn
```

## What It Does

* Alice visits the [Scout website](https://scout.sunlightfoundation.com/) and searches for terms of interest to her, e.g. ["intellectual property"](https://scout.sunlightfoundation.com/search/all/intellectual%20property).
* Alice subscribes to be sent messages via email when new items are published for those search terms: that is, new items related to her interest.
* Soon after new items are published, Alice receives one email message per interest, which may contain multiple new items.

### Notification settings

Alice may [log in](https://scout.sunlightfoundation.com/login) to [configure notification settings](https://scout.sunlightfoundation.com/account/settings):

* She may change the email frequency from "immediate" to "daily", or turn off all notifications. If daily, she receives a single email message for all interests once per day.
* She may [configure interests](https://scout.sunlightfoundation.com/account/subscriptions) to have different notification settings: she may set a notification to be sent immediately or daily, or she may turn off notifications for the interest.

### Collections

* Alice may [tag interests](https://scout.sunlightfoundation.com/account/subscriptions). All interests with the same tag are called a *collection* of interests.
* Collections are private by default, but if Alice fills in her user profile, she may share the collection in public.
* Bob may subscribe to Alice's collection to be sent messages when new items are published related to the interests in the collection. If Alice makes the collection private again, Bob will no longer receive messages.

### Other features

* Importing and delivering alerts for any RSS/Atom feed.
* All Scout-generated RSS feeds have [CORS](http://enable-cors.org/) enabled, so they can be accessed client-side directly, from any remote website.

## Under the Hood

* Scout checks for new items in multiple data sources. To add a new data source, you must write a *subscription adapter*. The adapter tells Scout how to query the data source with the search terms provided by its users.
* When users subscribe to be sent messages, they create an *interest*. The user may choose to receive new items for all data sources, or just one. An interest will have one or more *subscriptions* per data source.

## Re-use

We'd really love it if others used the Scout codebase to set up their own alert system. To that end, Scout's architecture is fairly well decoupled from the specific data sources that Sunlight's implementation currently uses.

But if you do want to set this up yourself, there will surely turn out to be more to do! Send [konklone](https://github.com/konklone) a message if this is something you're interested in.

### Custom Adapters

Set the environment variable `SCOUT_ADAPTER_PATH` to the path to the directory containing your adapters, for example:

```bash
SCOUT_ADAPTER_PATH=/path/to/adapters bundle exec unicorn
```

Each file within this directory must define an adapter class, and the filename must be the lowercase, underscored version of the class name. The adapter class must be defined in a `Subscriptions::Adapters` module.

### Maintaining Scout

It's helpful to understand a few things about keeping Scout running.

#### Upgrading Ruby

To upgrade the Ruby version, do the following in **each environment** Scout will run:

1. Update rbenv and ruby-build, by visiting `$HOME/.rbenv` and `$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build` and running `git pull` in both.
2. Run `rbenv install [version]`, where `[version]` might be `2.1.1` or `2.2.0`.
3. Update `.ruby-version` in the project root, to reflect the version you installed, and commit this to the repository.
4. Activate the new Ruby version. (`rbenv global [version]` is one way to do this.)
5. Install bundler with `gem install bundler`.
6. Install dependencies with `bundle install --local`.

You should also run the test suite with `rake` to make sure everything is fine! But you probably only need to do that in one environment.

#### Entering the admin console

An app console can be opened using `irb`, which comes with Ruby. It is very similar to `ipython` for Python.

Any text in `$HOME/.irbrc` will be automatically run as `irb` on startup.

Our production server is configured with a `.irbrc` that will load the app environment **automatically**, when `irb` is run from the app's current working directory.

But if you want to do it yourself, it's:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup'
require './config/environment'
```

Once those have been executed, classes like `User` and `Delivery` will be available to you.

#### Manually unsubscribing users

Sometimes, users write in and want to be unsubscribed, and no matter what you tell them, they insist the process is broken or that you should do it.

So, given an email address for a user you wish to unsubscribe:

* Open up an `irb` console with the app environment loaded (see prior section).
* `user = User.where(email: "their.email@example.com").first`
* (Double check that it's the right user and email address.)
* `user.unsubscribe!`

This will log an `Event` in the database recording the time and email of the unsubscribe, and what that user's notification values were prior to the unsubscribe.
